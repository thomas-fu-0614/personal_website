I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Mechanical, Electrical & Information Engineering](https://ie.wh.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Robotic Engineering, Reinforcment Learning, Large Language Models.I am currently applying for an master or phd degree in the US, during which I would like to further my research in developing general-purpose AI-powered humannoid robot.

Publications and current projects
======
1. Achieve spatial-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving through reward shaping (under review)
   
2. Large Language Model Aids Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Training (under review)
   We propose a framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning guided by a large language model. In this framework, the large language model acts as a teacher agent to guide the exploration of the high-level policy in hierarchical reinforcement learning. The low-level policy consists of a library of selection-based policies. The agent executes specific actions according to the low-level policy chosen by the high-level policy. Furthermore, to reduce the action space of the high-level policy, we decompose the high-level policy into skill options and goal options. The high-level policy is obtained by combining these two types of options.
   We set up four challenging tasks in the MiniGrid environment to evaluate the performance of this method. The results show that LLMHRL outperforms other baseline methods.
4. LLMZIP: Enabling automated data compression for efficient LLM training(writing)
   As previous research has proved quality data is crucial for LLM training, we developed an framework to use commercial LLM to cross-compare and select based on sample significance.
   Performance evaluation showed comparable performance versus human evaluation and significantly better than traditional LLM-selection method and Mathematical-selection.
6. Finetuning LLM for Environment Understanding and Decision making(current project)
7. LLM-guided Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Training for Pick-and-place robot(current project)
